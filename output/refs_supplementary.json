  {"id":"higgins2009","abstract":"Summary. Meta-analysis in the presence of unexplained heterogeneity is frequently undertaken by using a random-effects model, in which the effects underlying different studies are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution. Here we discuss the justification and interpretation of such models, by addressing in turn the aims of estimation, prediction and hypothesis testing. A particular issue that we consider is the distinction between inference on the mean of the random-effects distribution and inference on the whole distribution. We suggest that random-effects meta-analyses as currently conducted often fail to provide the key results, and we investigate the extent to which distribution-free, classical and Bayesian approaches can provide satisfactory methods. We conclude that the Bayesian approach has the advantage of naturally allowing for full uncertainty, especially for prediction. However, it is not without problems, including computational intensity and sensitivity to a priori judgements. We propose a simple prediction interval for classical meta-analysis and offer extensions to standard practice of Bayesian meta-analysis, making use of an example of studies of ‘set shifting’ ability in people with eating disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Higgins","given":"Julian P.

  {"id":"pedroza2018","abstract":"One of the main advantages of Bayesian analyses of clinical trials is their ability to formally incorporate skepticism about large treatment effects through the use of informative priors. We conducted a simulation study to assess the performance of informative normal, Student-t, and beta distributions in estimating relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes. Simulation scenarios varied the prior standard deviation (SD; level of skepticism of large treatment effects), outcome rate in the control group, true treatment effect, and sample size. We compared the priors with regards to bias, mean squared error (MSE), and coverage of 95% credible intervals. Simulation results show that the prior SD influenced the posterior to a greater degree than the particular distributional form of the prior. For RR, priors with a 95% interval of 0.50–2.0 performed well in terms of bias, MSE, and coverage under most scenarios. For OR, priors with a wider 95% interval of 0.23–4.35 had good performance. We recommend the use of informative priors that exclude implausibly large treatment effects in analyses of clinical trials, particularly for major outcomes such as mortality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Pedroza","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Han","given":"Weilu"},{"family":"Thanh Truong","given":"Van Thi"},{"family":"Green","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Tyson","given":"Jon E"}],"citation-key":"pedroza2018","container-title":"Statistical Methods in Medical Research","container-title-short":"Stat Methods Med Res","DOI":"10.1177/0962280215620828","ISSN":"0962-2802","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,1]]},"language":"en","note":"ECC: 0000012","page":"79-96","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd STM","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Performance of informative priors skeptical of large treatment effects in clinical trials: A simulation study","title-short":"Performance of informative priors skeptical of large treatment effects in clinical trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280215620828","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"rover2021","abstract":"The normal-normal hierarchical model (NNHM) constitutes a simple and widely used framework for meta-analysis. In the common case of only few studies contributing to the meta-analysis, standard approaches to inference tend to perform poorly, and Bayesian meta-analysis has been suggested as a potential solution. The Bayesian approach, however, requires the sensible specification of prior distributions. While noninformative priors are commonly used for the overall mean effect, the use of weakly informative priors has been suggested for the heterogeneity parameter, in particular in the setting of (very) few studies. To date, however, a consensus on how to generally specify a weakly informative heterogeneity prior is lacking. Here we investigate the problem more closely and provide some guidance on prior specification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Röver","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Bender","given":"Ralf"},{"family":"Dias","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Schmid","given":"Christopher H."},{"family":"Schmidli","given":"Heinz"},{"family":"Sturtz","given":"Sibylle"},{"family":"Weber","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Friede","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"rover2021","container-title":"Research Synthesis Methods","DOI":"10.1002/jrsm.1475","ISSN":"1759-2887","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","note":"ECC: 0000005 \n_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jrsm.1475","page":"448-474","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"On weakly informative prior distributions for the heterogeneity parameter in Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jrsm.1475","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"whoma","abstract":"Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of IL-6 antagonists in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have variously reported benefit, no effect, and harm.To estimate the association between administration of IL-6 antagonists compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality and other outcomes.Trials were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases between October 2020 and January 2021. Searches were not restricted by trial status or language. Additional trials were identified through contact with experts.Eligible trials randomly assigned patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to a group in whom IL-6 antagonists were administered and to a group in whom neither IL-6 antagonists nor any other immunomodulators except corticosteroids were administered. Among 72 potentially eligible trials, 27 (37.5%) met study selection criteria.In this prospective meta-analysis, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance–weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) for 28-day all-cause mortality.The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. There were 9 secondary outcomes including progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death and risk of secondary infection by 28 days.A total of 10 930 patients (median age, 61 years [range of medians, 52-68 years]; 3560 [33%] were women) participating in 27 trials were included. By 28 days, there were 1407 deaths among 6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths among 4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95]; P = .003 based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. The corresponding summary ORs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P &lt; .001) for tocilizumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36; P = .52) for sarilumab. The summary ORs for the association with mortality compared with usual care or placebo in those receiving corticosteroids were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.61-1.38) for sarilumab. The ORs for the association with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death, compared with usual care or placebo, were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for all IL-6 antagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.34) for sarilumab. Secondary infections by 28 days occurred in 21.9% of patients treated with IL-6 antagonists vs 17.6% of patients treated with usual care or placebo (OR accounting for trial sample sizes, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16).In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42021230155","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,2]]},"author":[{"literal":"The WHO Rapid Evidence Appraisal for COVID-19 Therapies (REACT) Working Group"}],"citation-key":"thewhorapidevidenceappraisalforcovid-19therapiesreactworkinggroup2021","container-title":"JAMA","container-title-short":"JAMA","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2021.11330","ISSN":"0098-7484","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,10]]},"note":"ECC: 0000005","page":"499-518","source":"Silverchair","title":"Association Between Administration of IL-6 Antagonists and Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Meta-analysis","title-short":"Association Between Administration of IL-6 Antagonists and Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.11330","volume":"326"},
  {"id":"thompson2002","abstract":"Appropriate methods for meta-regression applied to a set of clinical trials, and the limitations and pitfalls in interpretation, are insu ciently recognized. Here we summarize recent research focusing on these issues, and consider three published examples of meta-regression in the light of this work. One principal methodological issue is that meta-regression should be weighted to take account of both within-trial variances of treatment e ects and the residual between-trial heterogeneity (that is, heterogeneity not explained by the covariates in the regression). This corresponds to random e ects meta-regression. The associations derived from meta-regressions are observational, and have a weaker interpretation than the causal relationships derived from randomized comparisons. This applies particularly when averages of patient characteristics in each trial are used as covariates in the regression. Data dredging is the main pitfall in reaching reliable conclusions from meta-regression. It can only be avoided by prespeciÿcation of covariates that will be investigated as potential sources of heterogeneity. However, in practice this is not always easy to achieve. The examples considered in this paper show the tension between the scientiÿc rationale for using meta-regression and the di cult interpretative problems to which such analyses are prone.

  {"id":"trone2020","abstract":"The aim of this study was to propose a methodology for the assessment of non-inferiority with meta-analysis. Assessment of hypofractionated RT in prostate and breast cancers is used as an illustrative example. Non-inferiority assessment of an experimental treatment versus an active comparator should rely on two elements: (1) an estimation of experimental treatment’s effect versus the active comparator based on a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and (2) the value of an objective non-inferiority margin. This margin can be defined using the reported effect of active comparator and the percentage of the active comparator’s effect that is desired to be preserved. Non-inferiority can then be assessed by comparing the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of experimental treatment’s effect to the value of the objective non-inferiority margin. Application to hypofractionated RT in breast cancer showed that hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HWBI) appeared to be non-inferior to conventionally fractionated RT for local recurrence. This was not the case for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Concerning overall survival, non-inferiority could not be claimed for either HWBI or APBI. For prostate cancer, the lack of demonstrated significant superiority of conventional RT versus no RT precluded any conclusion regarding non-inferiority of hypofractionated RT.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Trone","given":"Jane-Chloé"},{"family":"Ollier","given":"Edouard"},{"family":"Chapelle","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Mismetti","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Cucherat","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Magné","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Zuffrey","given":"Paul Jacques"},{"family":"Laporte","given":"Silvy"}],"citation-key":"trone2020","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-72088-2","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,22]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"15415","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Assessment of non-inferiority with meta-analysis: example of hypofractionated radiation therapy in breast and prostate cancer","title-short":"Assessment of non-inferiority with meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72088-2","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"turner2015","abstract":"Numerous meta-analyses in healthcare research combine results from only a small number of studies, for which the variance representing between-study heterogeneity is estimated imprecisely. A Bayesian approach to estimation allows external evidence on the expected magnitude of heterogeneity to be incorporated.The aim of this paper is to provide tools that improve the accessibility of Bayesian meta-analysis. We present two methods for implementing Bayesian meta-analysis, using numerical integration and importance sampling techniques. Based on 14 886 binary outcome meta-analyses in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, we derive a novel set of predictive distributions for the degree of heterogeneity expected in 80 settings depending on the outcomes assessed and comparisons made. These can be used as prior distributions for heterogeneity in future meta-analyses.The two methods are implemented in R, for which code is provided. Both methods produce equivalent results to standard but more complex Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches. The priors are derived as log-normal distributions for the between-study variance, applicable to meta-analyses of binary outcomes on the log odds-ratio scale. The methods are applied to two example meta-analyses, incorporating the relevant predictive distributions as prior distributions for between-study heterogeneity.We have provided resources to facilitate Bayesian meta-analysis, in a form accessible to applied researchers, which allow relevant prior information on the degree of heterogeneity to be incorporated. © 2014 The Authors.

  {"id":"zotero-3144","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab improves outcomes in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the effectiveness of other immune modulating agents is unclear.\nMETHODS: We evaluated four immunomodulatory agents in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult participants with COVID-19 were randomized to receive tocilizumab, sarilumab, anakinra, or standard care (control). In addition, a small group (n=21) of participants were randomized to interferon-β1a. The primary outcome was an ordinal scale combining in-hospital mortality (assigned -1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial used a Bayesian statistical model with pre-defined triggers for superiority, equivalence or futility.\nRESULTS: Statistical triggers for equivalence between tocilizumab and sarilumab; and for inferiority of anakinra to the other active interventions were met at a planned adaptive analysis. Of the 2274 critically ill participants enrolled, 972 were assigned to tocilizumab, 485 to sarilumab, 378 to anakinra and 418 to control. Median organ support-free days were 7 (interquartile range [IQR] –1, 16), 9 (IQR –1, 17), 0 (IQR –1, 15) and 0 (IQR –1, 15) for tocilizumab, sarilumab, anakinra and control, respectively. Median adjusted odds ratios were 1.46 (95%CrI 1.13, 1.87), 1.50 (95%CrI 1.13, 2.00), and 0.99 (95%CrI 0.74, 1.35) for tocilizumab, sarilumab and anakinra, yielding 99.8%, 99.8% and 46.6% posterior probabilities of superiority, respectively, compared to control. Median adjusted odds ratios for hospital survival were 1.42 (95%CrI 1.05,1.93), 1.51 (95%CrI 1.06, 2.20) and 0.97 (95%CrI 0.66, 1.40) for tocilizumab, sarilumab and anakinra respectively, compared to control, yielding 98.8%, 98.8% and 43.6% posterior probabilities of superiority, respectively, compared to control. All treatments appeared safe.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe COVID-19 receiving organ support, tocilizumab and sarilumab are similarly effective at improving survival and reducing duration of organ support.
